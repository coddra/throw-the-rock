# Throw the Rock!

This is a simple physics simulation of a rock being thrown. The rock is thrown at a certain angle and velocity, and the simulation calculates the trajectory of the rock as it flies through the air. The simulation takes into account the effects of gravity and air resistance on the rock's motion.

Please don't try to throw a rock at someone in real life. It's dangerous and could cause serious injury. This simulation is just for fun and educational purposes. **Don't throw rocks at people!**

*this was suggested by Copilot xD*
